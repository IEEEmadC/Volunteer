Volunteers
V-4-Volunteers is an android application that helps volunteers across IEEE groups to actively organize and manage events. 
The application will have a user-friendly interface where the event organizer of a student branch or community can add an event. 
Once an event is added, several subsections will be generated for each event which includes various areas of interest when a particular event is conducted. Usually , when an event is conducted , there will be teams for registration, food, venue, sessions,sponsorship etc and there will be one or more persons who would take the overall leadership role. 
The leader can add the volunteers to individual groups.
The android application have its backend done in Node.js.
Once the leader adds the volunteers to the groups , he can view the tasks assigned to each individual thereby getting instantaneous details of people working in a particular team and to get a control over the activities happening in that particular team
Notifications will be generated whenever needed so as to remind the volunteers. The entire process is transparent and each volunteer can see what happens in the administration process. 
Entire details will be stored in a server database. 
The application will have a forum architecture and has  group chat features for the users.
The application is connected to firebase which is a real-time database.
